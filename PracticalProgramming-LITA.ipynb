PHP is one of the most commonly used langauges for dynamic websites was created by Rasmus Lerdorf for his own website and projects.  Having satisfied a need niche, others began asking to use the tool as well and adoption  grew to include even commercial enterprises.  However, because it was originally created as a personal project, there were little to no standards in place, and the language suffers from it's disorganized origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most languages can be adapted to nearly any type of prgammatic task, there are usually tasks that it has been optimized for.  For example, PHP is framed to deal with websites and connections to databases.  While it can be used for text processing purposes, it isn't exactly optimal or easy to do complex text processing tasks with it.  Python, however, has been extended with packages to be a powerful web language, but is highly optimized for working as a basic scripting language and includes excellent build in data and text processing tools.  Java, for example, lacks built in CSV reader libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Style\n",
      "\n",
      "We call programming languages \"languages\" because they are exactly that.  Each has a formal syntax for expressing actions and statements.  As I mentioned before, most commonly used programming languages are based around English.  However, this doesn't mean you should expect all of the vocabulary in those languages to make logical connections to English use.  Keywords will generally appear English-like or be real English words, but may be used in strange ways from what you expected.  Keep an open mind and put on your 'language learning hat' while going through this workshop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that in our introductory courses we often started by simply memorizing certain phrases and formulas before diving deep into what the core syntax meant.  This is very much also true of programming languages."
