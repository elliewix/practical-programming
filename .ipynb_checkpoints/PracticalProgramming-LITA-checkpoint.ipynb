    "#### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Every language has a reason for existence.  Someone came up with it for a reason.  PHP is an interesting example of how the origins significantly influence the current usage.  PHP is one of the most commonly used langauges for dynamic websites was created by Rasmus Lerdorf for his own website and projects.  Having satisfied a need niche, others began asking to use the tool as well and adoption  grew to include even commercial enterprises.  However, because it was originally created as a personal project, there were little to no standards in place, and the language suffers from it's disorganized origins.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most languages can be adapted to nearly any type of prgammatic task, there are usually tasks that it has been optimized for.  For example, PHP is framed to deal with websites and connections to databases.  While it can be used for text processing purposes, it isn't exactly optimal or easy to do complex text processing tasks with it.  Python, however, has been extended with packages to be a powerful web language, but is highly optimized for working as a basic scripting language and includes excellent build in data and text processing tools.  Java, for example, lacks built in CSV reader libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Style\n",
    "\n",
    "We call programming languages \"languages\" because they are exactly that.  Each has a formal syntax for expressing actions and statements.  As I mentioned before, most commonly used programming languages are based around English.  However, this doesn't mean you should expect all of the vocabulary in those languages to make logical connections to English use.  Keywords will generally appear English-like or be real English words, but may be used in strange ways from what you expected.  Keep an open mind and put on your 'language learning hat' while going through this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in our introductory courses we often started by simply memorizing certain phrases and formulas before diving deep into what the core syntax meant.  This is very much also true of programming languages."

    "Computers represent and store numbers differently than humans.  Languages like Java actually have five different numerical data types.  Python (at least in everyday use) only requires programmers to deal with two numerical datatypes. Why would we need more than one way to store numbers in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "This has to do with the legacy of early computing and how computers store data in memory. The key fact is that storing some kinds of numbers takes up less memory than other types of numbers.  With 64 units of memory space, practically any number can be stored. However, not all numbers need that much space. The vast majority of numbers only need 16 units of memory space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our earlier discussion about how early computer languages were closer to the computer's internal structure. When memory was very limited and expensive, allowing a number to take up more memory than necessary could render a project impossible from an engineering or budgetary perspective.  Programmers gained a real benefit from the variety of numerical data types that allowed them fine control over how much memory to allocate for each number they needed to store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the early days of computing, the amount of memory available in today's computers is incredibly huge and cheap (though not infinite!) Programmers can afford to be more relaxed when it comes to managing memory. Python is also better than early languages at automatically deciding how much memory is needed to store a given number and so takes care of much of this in the background for us.

You drive up and pass your clothes to them through the window.  They take those clothes in, process them, and then return them to you from the window.  You don't really know what's happening inside the cleaner's building, but you know your clothes are returned to you cleaned according to direction.\n",
